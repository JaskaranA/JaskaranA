- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaskaranA
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about opportunities particularly in the data science space while actively engaging in the finance community to learn 
more about algos
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, R, VBA, SQL, and a few other visualization tools
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that analyze financial data with respect to the housing market and debt levels taken on by 
Canadian/International governments. As a student that is still learning more about data science and the real world application, I am always open to new 
opportunities to learn more.
